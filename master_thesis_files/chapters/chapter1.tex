\section{ Motivation}

Elephants are dangerous and smart animals.\cite{scientificelephant}

Wild Lab claims:
In India alone, an average of 400 people and 100 elephants are killed every year as a result of human-wildlife conflict. 

Wild Lab
In Northeast-India, human elephant conflicts are increasingly common. Electric fences were developed to prevent elephants from entering villages and crop fields.

Elephants are intelligent animals and will eventually always find ways to break fences and enter crop fields. For example, tuskers learn how to break wires and poles with their tusks and elephants have been observed throwing logs and other tools on the wires.  Currently, to identify damaged fences and to understand how this happened, camera traps with motion sensors can be deployed. They send warning messages or trigger an alarm. However, camera traps are costly and their passive lasers canâ€™t differentiate between elephants and other wildlife (or people) and are thus constantly triggered by any movement

Early detection of elephants will prevent surprise encounters and will give people more time to choose the best response to prevent escalation into conflict. Existing early detection tools can only detect elephants at short distances


What is causing the Human-Elephant Conflict problem

    Steady degradation of habitat due to encroachment and an increasing human population
    Habitat loss due to land-use change resulting from encroachment, agriculture and infrastructure development
    Disruption of wildlife corridors
    Habitat degradation due to over-extraction and weed infestation (causing elephants to look for better fodder in cultivated fields) and monoculture plantations

What conflicts occur

    Crop raids
    Damage to property
    Human fatalities and injuries
    Elephant fatalities (accidental electrocution or poisoning)
    Retaliatory killings of elephant
        Describe the problem, role of IRNAS, Arribada and Smart parks, write about current solutions, power hungry raspi, proposed solution, "The goal of this dissertation project is to...", should be 2-3 pages long, a nice story.
