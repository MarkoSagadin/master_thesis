TODO SUMMARY



\section{Future work}

Our research into elephant detection with the aid of Machine Learning models yielded promising results and should be improved.

In terms of model performance, we can always improve it by gathering more relevant training data.
Dataset that we used contained several thousands images of elephants, but only couple thousands images of humans and only few hundreds images of cows.
In order to train a more robust and reliable model we should gather more thermal images of humans and livestock, especially goats.

It would be interesting to further explore models trained with Transfer Learning technique.
We saw that Transfer Learning models reached higher accuracies with shorter inferencing times compared to other models.
We expect that running a random hyperparameter search with the smaller version of pre-trained MobileNetV2 model could produce optimal results.

In terms of the system performance, testing our early warning system in field would give us key insights what could be improved.
With a device deployed in a zoo, we could monitor its performance and see which conditions degrade its performance.
We could add a SD card to the system and save every taken image, and result of its inference.

By observing performance of the model in the field we would see if extremely low inference times are really needed.
It might be feasible to run CNN models on slower, low-power, Cortex-M4 microcontrollers.
Although we are expecting longer inference times, we would benefit from a simpler system design and a lower overall price of the embedded system.

In terms of battery life performance, we can definitely lower the current consumption of the nRF52 microcontroller in the low-power state, reaching 10\si{\micro\apmere} with LR1110 in sleep mode is completely possible.
Early detection system should be implemented on a custom printed circuit board, such approach would give use more control over current consumption than the setup that we created from development boards.

TODO You are probably not finished with this section, you need feedback.


\section{Final words}

Machine Learning on the embedded devices is opening doors to various, wonderful applications that were not possible 3 years ago.






Main three sections: summary, results commentary, and looking forward (future work)

, you are summarizing the paper for a reader who had read the introduction and the body of the report already, and should already have a strong sense of key concepts. Your conclusion, then, is for a more informed reader and should look quite different than the introduction.



Sklep je zadnje poglavje zaključnega dela. V njem podamo objektivno oceno rezultatov in
jih povežemo s problemom, zastavljenim v uvodu. Če se nam zdi ustrezneje, lahko opis
rezultatov in diskusijo podamo v sklepu namesto v glavnem delu. Nakažemo morebitne
težave in opažanja, ki so se nam pojavila med delom, ter podamo napotke za nadaljnje
delo.
