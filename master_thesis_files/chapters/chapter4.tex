Part of this thesis was concerned with porting TFLite Micro to \textbf{libopencm3}, our platform of choice.
To compile source files and build binaries TFLite Micro uses build automation tool \textbf{GNU Make}.
One large makefile that includes several platform specific makefiles dictates how firmware is built.
By providing command line arguments users decide which example has to be compiled and for which platform.
The build system makes some assumptions about locations of the platform specific files, which in case of example projects are scattered over GitHub repository.
This and several other reasons make library hard to use when porting it to a new platform.
In section TODO ADD REFERENCE we describe our build system that keeps library and application specific code separated in a clear and concise manner.
